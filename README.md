   - Enable the Google Cloud Translation API for your project.
   - Create service account credentials and download the JSON key file. Save it securely.

3. **Set Environment Variable:**
   - Uncomment the line with `os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS']` in your code by removing the `#` at the beginning.
   - Replace `'path/to/your/credentials.json'` with the actual path to your downloaded JSON key file.

4. **Run the Code:**
   - Save the modified code to a Python file, for example, `translate_recipe.py`.
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
   - Run the script:
     ```
     python translate_recipe.py
     ```
   - This will execute the script, and you should see the output, including the original and translated recipes.

Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine, and the `pip install` command should be used based on your Python environment. If you are using a virtual environment, activate it before running the `pip install` command.
